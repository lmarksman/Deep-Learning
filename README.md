# Deep-Learning

The purpose of the analysis is based on the asking amount and the income amount. How liking is the applicant funding to be successful. 

* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
  * Affiliation, Classification, Application_Type, Organization are the variables
* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
  * Affliation and Association
* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
  * Name, Use_Case

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  * 80 neurons, 3 layers, 30 activation functions. 
  * This gave the closest trainable parameters without producing non-trainable params
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  * No not able to achieve a target model
* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
  * reduction of inputs, increase neurons, layers and functions



**Summary**: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.

Although the model does perform well, there are areas that it can be improved. Reduction in inputs and an increase in data to train with.
